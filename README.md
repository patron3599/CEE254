Stanford University - Data Analytics for Physical Systems 

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict PM2.5, weather, and traffic data. PM 2.5 data is typically used for monitoring air quality. 
This measurement is closely related to urban systems and human activities, as well as weather and environmental conditions. Traditionally, air quality
and weather information is collected from static sensors located throughout urban areas, which results in sparse measurements and incomplete air 
quality information. The data provided are collected from realworld deployments in multiple cities through mobile crowdsensing (i.e., the sensors
are attached to a large number of mobile vehicles and collect data while moving around the cities with these vehicles), as well as static sensors. 
The objective of using both mobile crowdsensing and static sensing modalities is to provide more robust and ubiquitous measurements of PM 2.5, traffic, 
and overall air quality. This project develops data analysis methods and implements them using the given datasets.

Adhering to the Stanford Honor Code, the code in this repository is not meant to be used for future projects or assignments.
